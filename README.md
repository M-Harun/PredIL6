# PredIL6

# Introduction
**PredIL6** is an ensemble machine learning framework for predicting **Interleukin-6 (IL-6)–inducing peptides**. It combines probability outputs from **148 single-feature machine learning and deep learning models** using a **genetic algorithm–based meta-classifier**, achieving high predictive accuracy and robustness.
The project covers dataset construction, feature encoding, ensemble model training, validation, and performance evaluation using multiple statistical and machine learning metrics.

For a detailed description of the methodology and results, please refer to the following publication:

# Execution
# 1 Setting directories
Users must download all the directories  
Users must keep the structure of the directories of the programs  

# 2 Construction of dataset
Before simulation, users build dataset files for cross validataion and independent test:   
$sh data_const.sh  
The file of data_const.sh consists of the following programs  

## 2-1 Programs for removal of peptides including non-standard amino acids and for analysis of peptide sequence length distribution
Users remove the peptides including non-standard amino acids  
$python data_stand.py  
Users can evaluate the peptide sequence length distribution.  
$python data_analsis_1.py  

## 2-2 Programs for making training and test datasets
Users prepare the training dataset to conduct 5-fold cross validation.  
$python train_division_1.py  
Users adjust the test dataset in the fasta format.  
$python test_fasta.py  
  
# 3 Baselin model construction and meta-classifier construction
Users train a series of baseline models with the training dataset and then construct a meta-classifier. Furthermore, users test the baseline models and the meta-classifier, evaluate their prediction performance (metrics), and save the metrics.  
$cd program  
$sh process.sh  
The file of process.sh consists of the following programs (3-1, 3-2, 3-3, 3-4).  
The maximum sequence length can be set to 35.  

## 3-1 Programs for training and testing of the baseline models
Users train the baseline models with machine learning methods via 5-fold cross validation.  
$cd program/ml  
$python ml_train_test_46.py  
Users train the baseline models with deep learning methods via 5-fold cross validation.  
$cd program/network  
$python train_test_86.py  

## 3-2 Program for meta-classifier construction
Users fuse the probability scores outputted by all the baseline models, and train a meta-classifier by using the fused data. Genetic algorithms are used to determine the weight of each baseline model to optimize the meta-classifier.  
$cd program  
$python ml_fusion_GA.py  

## 3-3 Program for evaluation of the baseline models
Users evaluate the prediction performance (metrics) of the baseline models and meta-classifier. The metrics are saved in the csv file.  
$cd program  
$python analysis_622.py  

## 3-4 Programs for output of prediction results
Users save the csv file of the metrics of the baseline models in the excel format.  
$cd program  
$python csv_xlsx_34.py  
Users save the csv file of the metrics of the meta-classifier in the excel format.  
$cd program  
$python csv_xlsx_37.py
